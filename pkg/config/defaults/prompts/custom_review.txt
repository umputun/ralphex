# custom review prompt
# this prompt is sent to a custom external review tool (script)
# the script receives this as a file and should run the code review
#
# available variables:
#   {{DIFF_INSTRUCTION}} - git diff command appropriate for current iteration
#   {{GOAL}} - human-readable goal description
#   {{PLAN_FILE}} - path to the plan file being executed
#   {{DEFAULT_BRANCH}} - default branch name (main, master, trunk, etc.)

You are reviewing code changes for: {{GOAL}}

## Get the Diff

Run this command to see the changes:
{{DIFF_INSTRUCTION}}

## Review Focus

Analyze the code for:

1. Bugs and logic errors - incorrect behavior, edge cases, null/nil handling
2. Security issues - injection, XSS, secrets exposure, improper validation
3. Race conditions - concurrent access, shared state, missing synchronization
4. Error handling - silent failures, ignored errors, missing fallbacks
5. Test coverage - missing tests, inadequate edge case coverage
6. Code quality - unnecessary complexity, poor naming, unclear logic

## Output Format

Report issues as a structured list:

- file:line - description of issue
- file:line - description of issue

If no issues found, output: NO ISSUES FOUND

## Important

- Focus on real problems, not style preferences
- Check if issues are already mitigated in the code
- Only report issues you can verify by reading the actual code
- Be specific about file paths and line numbers

When done, output exactly: <<<RALPHEX:CODEX_REVIEW_DONE>>>
